# Build a very basic Pokémon class that allows you to simulate battles
# in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game mechanic, as well as feed your Pokémon.
#
# The class should follow these specifications:
#
# - Each Pokemon should have a `name`, `primary_type`, `max_hp` and `hp`
# - Primary types should be limited to `water`, `fire` and `grass`
# - Implement a `battle()` method based on rock-paper-scissors that
#   decides who wins based only on the `primary_type`:
#       water > fire > grass > water
# - Display messages that explain who won or lost a battle
# - If a Pokemon loses a battle, they lose some of their `hp`
# - If you call the `feed()` method on a Pokemon, they regain some `hp`
