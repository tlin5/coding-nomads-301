# Create a decorator that censors potentially offensive words from a text.
# For example, assuming that "shoot" was considered an offensive word:
# A function that would normall return this text:
#    "I bumped my toe! Shoot!"
# Would, after decorating it with `@censor()`, return:
#    "I bumped my toe! S****!"
