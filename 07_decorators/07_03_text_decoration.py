# Write a decorator that literally decorates text output.
# Make it so the symbol it uses can be an argument to the decorator
#
# The output of a function that returns `"Hello"` that has been
# decorated like with `@decorate("*")` should look like this:
#
# ******************************
# Hello
# ******************************
