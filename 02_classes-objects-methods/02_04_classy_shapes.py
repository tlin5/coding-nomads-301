# Create two classes that model a rectangle and a circle.
# The rectangle class should be constructed by length and width
# while the circle class should be constructed by radius.
#
# Write methods in the appropriate class so that you can calculate
# the area of both the rectangle and the circle, the perimeter
# of the rectangle, and the circumference of the circle.
